# JavaStudentOrientation_builderPattern

Designed a Student Orientation software in Java using builder pattern to efficiently assign students
with their courses based on student's preference order in a way such that the total preference is as much
low as possible and perform other activities in any order the student likes to and finally show the overall
activities performed by a student during his/her orientation.
